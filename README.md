# Diet App 

Diet apps are software applications for tracking nutritional intake and managing diets for healthy eating, weight loss, weight maintenance, weight gain, and fitness. Diet apps are also used to track food sensitivities, allergies, and medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Most diet apps are tools for mobile devices, such as smart-phones and tablets.
<br/>
Millions of people worldwide follow weight-loss diets or track their nutritional intake or avoid certain types of food for medical reasons. With the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices, apps have made following prescribed diets significantly easier, more convenient, and less expensive. Some diet apps function as companion tools for diet books or online or in-person weight-management programs such as Weight Watchers.
